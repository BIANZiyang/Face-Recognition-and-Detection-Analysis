// This function processes the training images and generates the xml files that are needed for
// facial recognition.
//
// Note to makers: You will NOT need to call this function. This function is used to train the
// images, however, the assignment submission will already have the trained XML files. There is
// no need to re-train the images - in fact, if you re-train this, you will not get the same XML
// file because I re-named some of the sample images to work with these functions.
//
// This function was included purely so you could see how I trained the XML files
